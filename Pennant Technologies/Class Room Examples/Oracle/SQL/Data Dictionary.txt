Data Dictionary:
------------------
The data dictionary is a comprehensive set of tables and views owned by the DBA users SYS and SYSTEM, which activates when ORACLE is initially installed, and is a central source of information for the ORACLE RDBMS itself and for all users of ORACLE. 
The tables are automatically maintained by Oracle, and hold a set of tables and views, containing information about database objects, user’s privileges events and use.
The data dictionary is automatically created when the database is created. Oracle updates the data dictionary in response to every Data Definition Language.
