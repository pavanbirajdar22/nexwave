order by clause

	asc
	desc

	select * from emp order by empno desc;	
	select * from emp  where job like 'CLERK' order by empno desc;



GROUP BY clause

groups the selected rows based on the value of expr for each row and returns a single row of summary information for each group.

SELECT DEPTNO, MIN(SAL), MAX(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE JOB = 'CLERK' GROUP BY DEPTNO;

SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB = 'CLERK' GROUP BY DEPTNO;

select empno,sum(sal) from emp group by empno;


select empno,sum(sal) from emp group by rollup (empno);

select empno,job,sum(sal) from emp group by rollup (empno,job)

select empno,job,sum(sal) from emp group by (empno,job)

select empno,job,sum(sal) from emp group by cube (empno,job)

select grouping (empno),empno,sum(sal) from emp group by rollup (empno)


HAVING

restricts the groups of rows returned to those groups for which the specified condition is TRUE. If we omit this clause, Oracle returns summary rows for all groups.

SELECT DEPTNO, MIN(SAL), MAX(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE JOB='CLERK' GROUP BY DEPTNO HAVING MIN(SAL)>1000;
